INSPECT-SPSW
_______________________________________________________________________________________
The INSPECT–SPSW program is designed to simplify the process of structural modeling and lateral loads analyses for SPSWs utilizing the OpenSees program. The creation of the input text file for OpenSees is facilitated by the GUI pre-processor, while running analyses and manipulating outputs are fully automated by the GUI post-processor in INSPECT–SPSW. The high-level handling and automation capabilities provided by INSPECT–SPSW liberate the structural/earthquake engineer from the distractions of maneuvering through the minute syntax details. Thus, transforming SPSW modeling and design from a tedious exercise into a streamlined and seamless experience without compromising its inherent rigor. INSPECT–SPSW would be found useful and appealing to structural/earthquake engineering students, researchers, and practitioners alike. The freely distributed executable version of the OpenSees program, which is made free and publically available at this webpage: [https://opensees.berkeley.edu], is included within the INSPECT–SPSW package.
